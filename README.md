# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-2017
Project for the Machine Learning course - using PCA + KNN. 

## Introduction

The analysis processes and results are explained in ML_Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer_Report.pdf   
Data is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

## Structure
1. ML_Handwritten_Digit_Visualization.R
  - Plot a sample of digits 
  - Distribution of each digit (bar chart)
  - Mean and Variance of each digit
 
2. ML_Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.R   
  - PCA on digits
  - find number of PCs to extract by propotion of variance explained additionally by adding 10 more PCs.
  - use CV to determine K of KNN

## Notice
This is the first Machine Learning course I took.  
The final performance reaches 98%.
